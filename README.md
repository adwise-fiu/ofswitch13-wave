# OpenFlow 1.3 and wave module for ns-3 #
This is a Modified OFSwitch13 module with switch ports to include DSRC capabilities. Allowing [ns-3 Network Simulator][ns-3] users to simulate Software-Defined Networks (SDN) with [OpenFlow 1.3][ofp13] capabilities. 
We also modified the WAVE netdevice definition to include the ofswitch13 callback.

# Acknowledgment #
The initial version of the code was developed by Luciano J Chaves [OpenFlow 1.3 Software Switch for ns-3][ofs13].
